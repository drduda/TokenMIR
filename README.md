# TokenMIR
Code and PDF of my master thesis. Uses the Vector-Quantization tokens generated by Jukebox by OpenAI for Music Information Retrival Tasks. 

Look at the wiki page on how to execute the shell scripts with SLURM. 

# Structure
The code is written with PyTorch Lightning. `architecture.py` entails the deep learning architectures. `systems.py` entails the learning paradigmas (self supervised, supervised learning etc.) and `train.py` executes the training.
