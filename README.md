# TokenMIR
Code and PDF of my master thesis. My thesis is a comparative study between Vector-Quantization tokens generated by Jukebox (an OpenAI model) and classical mel spectrograms and investigates which representation performs better on Music Information Retrival Tasks. 

Look at the wiki page on how to execute the shell scripts with SLURM. 

# Structure
The code is written with PyTorch Lightning. `architecture.py` entails the deep learning architectures. `systems.py` entails the learning paradigmas (self supervised, supervised learning etc.) and `train.py` executes the training. As the name suggest `master_thesis.pdf` is the master thesis itself.
